# Software Requirements Fundamentals

## Definition of a Software Requirement

* A property of something that allows it to solve a real-world problem.
* Must be verifiable within resource constraints.
* Some attributes:
  * **Unique identifier**: Allows to be subject to configuration management.
  * **Priority rating**: Enables trade-off decisions.
  * **Status value**: Enables progress tracking.

## Product and Process requirements

* **Product requirement** 
  * Need or constraint on the *software itself*.
  * Example: "The software shall verify that a student meets all pre-requisites before they register for a course."
* **Process requirement**
  * Need or constraint on the *software development process*.
  * Example: "The software shall be developed using a RUP process."

* Some product requirements generate implicit process requirements.

## Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements

* **Functional requirements**
  * The functions the software is to execute (features).
* **Nonfunctional requirements**
  * Constraints to the solution. 
  * Also known as quality requirements.
  * Can be further classified as:
    * **Performance** requirements
    * **Maintainability** requirements
    * **Safety** requirements
    * **Reliability** requirements
    * **Security** requirements
    * **Interopability** requirements
